## 1. Definition: Subspace (부분공간)

A subset $W$ of a vector space $V$ over a field $F$ is called a **subspace** of $V$ if $W$ is a vector space over $F$ with the same operations of addition and scalar multiplication defined on $V$.

## 2. Theorem 1.3 (Subspace Test)

Let $V$ be a vector space and $W$ be a subset of $V$.
$W$ is a subspace of $V$ if and only if the following three conditions hold:

1.  $0 \in W$ (Zero vector exists / $W$ is not empty)
2.  **Closed under addition**: $x, y \in W \implies x + y \in W$
3.  **Closed under scalar multiplication**: $c \in F, x \in W \implies cx \in W$

### Proof ($\Leftarrow$)
Assume conditions (1), (2), and (3) are true. We want to show $W$ is a vector space.
Since $W \subseteq V$, properties like commutativity and associativity are inherited from $V$. We only need to check the existence of the additive identity and additive inverse.

**1. Additive Identity:**
By condition (1), $0 \in W$.

**2. Additive Inverse:**
For each $x \in W$, we need to show $-x \in W$.
By Theorem 1.2, we know that $(-1)x = -x$.
Since $W$ is closed under scalar multiplication (Condition 3), for $x \in W$ and scalar $-1 \in F$:

$$
(-1)x = -x \in W
$$

Thus, $W$ is a subspace of $V$.

## 3. Examples of Subspaces

### Example 1: Symmetric Matrices
Let $W$ be the set of symmetric matrices ($A^T = A$) in $M_{n \times n}(F)$.

1.  **Zero vector:** $0^T = 0 \implies 0 \in W$
2.  **Addition:** If $A, B \in W$ (i.e., $A^T=A, B^T=B$), then:
    $$
    (A+B)^T = A^T + B^T = A + B
    $$
    So, $A+B \in W$.
3.  **Scalar Multiplication:** If $a \in F, A \in W$, then:
    $$
    (aA)^T = aA^T = aA
    $$
    So, $aA \in W$.

$\therefore W$ is a subspace of $M_{n \times n}(F)$.

### Example 2: Polynomials ($P_n(F)$)
$P_n(F)$ is the set of polynomials with degree less than or equal to $n$.

1.  $0$ polynomial has degree $-\infty$ (or $-1$), which is $\le n$. So $0 \in P_n(F)$.
2.  Sum of two polynomials of degree $\le n$ also has degree $\le n$.
3.  Scalar multiple of a polynomial preserves or decreases degree.
    $\therefore P_n(F)$ is a subspace of $P(F)$.

### Example 3: Continuous Functions ($C(\mathbb{R})$)
$C(\mathbb{R})$ is the set of all continuous real-valued functions.

1.  Constant function $f(x) = 0$ is continuous.
2.  Sum of continuous functions is continuous.
3.  Product of a scalar and a continuous function is continuous.
    $\therefore C(\mathbb{R})$ is a subspace of $\mathcal{F}(\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{R})$.

### Example 4: Diagonal Matrices
Set of diagonal matrices is a subspace of $M_n(F)$.
(Note: Diagonal matrix means $A_{ij} = 0$ for $i \neq j$. Upper triangular means $A_{ij} = 0$ for $i > j$.)

## 4. Theorem 1.4: Intersection of Subspaces

Any intersection of subspaces of a vector space $V$ is a subspace of $V$.

### Proof
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a collection of subspaces of $V$, and let $W$ be the intersection of all subspaces in $\mathcal{C}$ ($W = \bigcap_{U \in \mathcal{C}} U$).

**(i) Zero vector:**
Since every subspace contains $0$, the intersection $W$ must contain $0$.
$$
0 \in W
$$

**(ii) Closed under operations:**
Let $a \in F$ and $x, y \in W$.
Then $x, y$ are contained in **every** subspace in $\mathcal{C}$.
Since each subspace in $\mathcal{C}$ is closed under addition and scalar multiplication:

$$
x+y \in U \quad \text{and} \quad ax \in U \quad (\text{for all } U \in \mathcal{C})
$$

Therefore, $x+y$ and $ax$ are in the intersection $W$.
$$
x+y \in W, \quad ax \in W
$$

$\therefore W$ is a subspace of $V$.
